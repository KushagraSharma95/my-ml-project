## Abstract

This project develops a model to detect and localize pneumonia from chest X-ray images using data from the RSNA challenge. The approach combines classification and bounding box regression to identify lung opacities, addressing class imbalance and potential duplicate exams. Initial results demonstrate reasonable sensitivity with localization capability, suggesting utility for clinical triage.

## 1 Introduction

Pneumonia is a significant cause of mortality, and timely identification through chest radiographs can improve patient outcomes. The RSNA Pneumonia Detection Challenge provides a benchmark dataset for automated detection and localization of pneumonia-related opacities. This work builds models to classify X-rays and predict corresponding bounding boxes.

## 2 Related Work

Deep learning has revolutionized medical image analysis, particularly using convolutional neural networks for disease classification and localization. Prior studies have addressed diseases such as tuberculosis and pneumonia in chest radiographs, emphasizing both detection sensitivity and interpretability through localization.

## 3 Data

The dataset consists of annotated chest X-ray images from the RSNA challenge, with approximately one-third labeled positive for pneumonia. An imbalance exists between positive and negative cases. Patient-level deduplication was non-trivial due to missing unique identifiers, requiring heuristic checks. Image quality and variability posed additional preprocessing challenges.

## 4 Methodology

Images were preprocessed for uniformity in resolution and intensity. Models were trained to output both binary classification (presence of pneumonia) and bounding boxes for localization. Techniques to counter class imbalance included weighted loss functions and sampling strategies. Standard CNN backbones were adapted to this multi-task setting.

## 5 Experimental Setup

Performance was evaluated using detection accuracy, localization precision (e.g., intersection-over-union thresholds), and sensitivity-specificity trade-offs. Cross-validation and holdout test splits were used to ensure robustness. Calibration of the modelâ€™s confidence was also assessed to reduce false positives in clinical settings.

## 6 Results

The model identified pneumonia-positive cases with reasonable sensitivity. Localization predictions were generally accurate, though variability in opacity size and shape introduced challenges. Handling class imbalance and potential duplicate exams was critical to avoid biased performance estimates.

## 7 Discussion

The lack of unique patient identifiers complicated accurate error attribution. False positives required careful threshold tuning to avoid unnecessary follow-ups. Image heterogeneity affected generalization, highlighting the benefit of more diverse training data and potential domain adaptation techniques.

## 8 Conclusion

Automated detection and localization of pneumonia from chest X-rays is feasible with deep learning models, offering value in triage workflows. Future directions include improved deduplication, incorporation of clinical metadata, and deployment considerations for real-time screening.
