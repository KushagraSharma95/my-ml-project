## Abstract

This work addresses predicting customer transaction value using anonymized, sparse features from the Santander Value Prediction Challenge. Regression models with regularization and feature sparsity handling were developed, outperforming naive baselines. The study highlights techniques for managing high-dimensional sparse data and improving generalization in personalized financial recommendations.

## 1 Introduction

Understanding customer value beyond binary transaction decisions enables banks to tailor product offerings and marketing. This project aims to predict continuous monetary value of future customer activity using anonymized feature sets, thereby improving personalization in financial services.

## 2 Related Work

Customer value modeling has been explored using a variety of regression and machine learning techniques. Sparse high-dimensional data is typical in financial contexts, and prior work applies regularization, dimensionality reduction, and ensemble methods to extract signal while preventing overfitting.

## 3 Data

Data originates from the Santander Value Prediction Challenge on Kaggle. The dataset comprises anonymized features with high sparsity; many features are seldom active, indicating potential indicator flags. Proper preprocessing was required to identify and retain informative variables.

## 4 Methodology

Regression models, including regularized linear models and tree-based ensembles, were trained to predict continuous transaction values. Feature engineering prioritized sparsity-aware transformations, and regularization mitigated overfitting. Ensemble stacking was considered to blend complementary model strengths.

## 5 Experimental Setup

Models were evaluated using error metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) with cross-validation to assess generalization. Baseline comparisons included naive predictors (e.g., mean value). Feature importance analyses identified key contributors.

## 6 Results

The proposed models outperformed naive baselines, successfully capturing underlying patterns despite feature sparsity. Only a subset of features contributed significantly, as revealed through importance metrics, enabling potential dimensionality reduction.

## 7 Discussion

High sparsity required careful regularization and selection to avoid noisy signals. The anonymized nature of features limited interpretability but preserved privacy. Future personalization could integrate temporal behavior to refine value predictions dynamically.

## 8 Conclusion

Predicting customer transaction value in sparse, anonymized feature spaces is viable with robust regression and regularization techniques. Improvements can be driven by temporal modeling and better feature selection strategies.
