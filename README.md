## Project Summaries

### Numerai Stock Prediction
A ranking/regression task using Numerai's encrypted dataset to predict stock performance. The goal is to build models that generalize without relying on domain-specific features, leveraging gradient boosting methods like LightGBM and XGBoost. The write-up covers data understanding, modeling approach, evaluation, and ethical considerations. References are provided with hyperlinks at the end of the paper.

### EPL Match Outcome Prediction
Predicting English Premier League match outcomes using event-level football data (e.g., StatsBomb). Combines domain-aware statistical modeling (e.g., adapted Poisson models) with modern machine learning (e.g., XGBoost) to capture scoring dynamics and betting-market inefficiencies.

### RSNA Pneumonia Detection
Deep learning on medical imaging—identifying pneumonia in chest X-rays using the RSNA challenge dataset. The project explores residual networks (ResNet), data preprocessing, model training, and performance metrics tailored to a medical diagnosis setting.

### Santander Customer Value Prediction
A predictive modeling task from the Santander competition focused on estimating customer value. The write-up details feature engineering, boosting-based models like LightGBM/XGBoost, target definitions, evaluation strategies, and insights for business impact.

### Census Income Classification
Binary classification using the UCI Adult dataset to predict whether an individual earns more than \$50K. The project includes fairness discussion, feature importance, model choice, and accuracy vs. bias trade-offs.

## Usage

Open any of the `.md` files in a Markdown viewer (VSCode, GitHub preview, Obsidian, etc.) to read the full write-up. You can also use this README to navigate to the individual documents if rendered in a Markdown-aware environment.

## Next Steps (Suggestions)

- Standardize each paper into a shared template (e.g., consistent “Abstract”, “Introduction”, “Methods”, “Results”, “Conclusion” sections).
- Generate HTML or slide versions for portfolio/blog publication.
- Auto-generate summary cards or badges for each project (e.g., key metrics, tech stack).
- Extract key code snippets and notebooks to accompany each write-up.
- Publish as a personal portfolio with clean routing for each project.
